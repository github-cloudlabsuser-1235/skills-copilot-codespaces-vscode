# Sample Node.js Application

This document provides an overview of a sample Node.js application, including its architecture and workflow. Diagrams are included to help visualize the system.

---

## Application Overview

The sample Node.js application is a web-based service that allows users to perform CRUD operations on a database. It uses the following technologies:

- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building APIs.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for data storage.

## Architecture Diagram

The following diagram illustrates the architecture of the application:

    API -->|Database Queries| DB[MongoDB]
    DB -->|Responses| API
    API -->|HTTP Responses| Client
```

## Workflow Diagram

The workflow for a typical CRUD operation is shown below:

```mermaid

    participant User
    participant Client
    participant Server
    participant Database

    User ->> Client: Sends Request
    Client ->> Server: API Call
    Server ->> Database: Query
    Database -->> Server: Response
    Server -->> Client: API Response
    Client -->> User: Displays Result
```
